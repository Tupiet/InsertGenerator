# InsertGenerator

## Description
Welcome to InsertGenerator! This project aims to simplify the job of obtaining data for testing, and to insert them easily in a database.

This repository includes all what's needed to execute it easily. It's composed by two docker containers. One is for the front-end, and another is for the back-end (a Node.js server).

## How to use it
Just run `docker-compose up -d` and look at localhost:83. The program will be running there!

## What do I need to use it?
You just need to have docker installed. Everything else will be downloaded and installed automatically. You also need to have port 83 and 84 of the router free (83 is back-end, and 84 is back-end).
